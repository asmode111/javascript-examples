          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>The pagination wasn't built to be scaled and handle a lot of pages. Therefor it looks kinda bad. It just lists all the pages from 1 to 15 with left and right arrow buttons.</p>
          <h3>TODO</h3>
          <p>Make the pagination user friendly and scalable like this example image. Focus on the JavaScript and just try to make it work. It doesn't need to be your best looking code and it doesn't need to be pixel perfect, but it needs to work accordingly.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>First- and last page button should always be visible. Always letting the user jump to first and last page.</li>
            <li>Left and right arrow buttons should only be visible / enabled <strong>if necessary</strong>. You can decide if you want to remove them or disable / enable them.</li>
            <li>Highlight current page button and render two more buttons from that sequence. Preferably letting the user navigate to the previous page or to the next page.</li>
            <li>Collapse page buttons with dots (...). The dots should have same styling as the buttons and it's OK if the dots are clickable but they do not have any function when clicked. And the dots indicate that more than one button is collapsed.</li>
            <li>Remember that the pagination should be scalable and handle any number of pages.</li>
